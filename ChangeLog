12/05/2020
- fixed a session leak in access_token() and for a very unlikely
  code-path in authenticate(); authenticate will still normally not
  close the session as users may want to use it after the method
  returns; see
  https://github.com/zmartzone/lua-resty-openidc#sessions-and-locking
  see #374

11/17/2020
- changed dependency on lua-resty-jwt to allow newer versions in
  luarocks packaging; see #363, #366, #362;
  thanks to @Darguelles and @kayano

04/08/2020
- openidc.call_userinfo_endpoint will now invoke the discovery

  of the userinfo endpoint

03/27/2020
- added a function that implements OpenID Connect Front Channel Logout

02/06/2020
- ability to disable keepalive from lua-resty-http
  By disabling keepalive we disable the native connection pool,
  avoiding errors when dealing with invalid connections. This is
  specially useful when proxying ajax requests.

02/05/2020
- no longer echo the URI parameters back on default error page when
  OIDC provider returns an error in call to redirect_uri; see #306;
  thanks @barrelmaker97

10/02/2019

  will get marked as no longer authenticated and a proper error is
  returned; see #286; thanks @cretzel

07/15/2019
- release 1.7.2

07/09/2019
- added unauth_action='deny' to reject unauthenticated requests rather
  than start the authorization code grant flow; see #271; based on
  suggested change by @nmaniwa
- read introspection_endpoint from discovery document when present; see #255

05/01/2019
- performance enhancement by caching the result of ngx.req.get_headers
  during the authenticate call.

  regenerated after a token refresh

04/25/2019
- improved error handling when starting session; see #264; thanks @vershnik

03/18/2019
- fixed accidental use of global variable err in revoke_tokens_on_logout;
  see #253, #254; thanks @arcivanov
- fixed a few additional cases of using global symbols detected by lualint

03/15/2019
- allow to tap into authentication workflow by providing an option
  to specify lifecycle hooks via `opts.lifecycle`

03/07/2019
- made the checks for certain HTTP headers handle the case where
  multiple headers exist; thanks @ci42

03/06/2019
- don't overwrite opts.discovery when an error occurs calling the
  discovery endpoint; see #250

02/18/2019
- release 1.7.1

12/17/2018
- don't select one of the jwt token auth methods if the required key
  material is not present; see #238

11/13/2018
- fixed a bad error return value in certain setups of
  bearer_jwt_verify; see #234; thanks @JoshTheGoldfish

11/09/2018

10/18/2018
- add token revocation support on logout (opts.revoke_tokens_on_logout)

10/16/2018
- lua-resty-openidc now creates a new session whenever the token(s)
  are refreshed, trying to soften the impact when multiple requests
  race to refresh the token at the same time. See #190 and #209

10/11/2018
- url-encode client_id/client_secret; closes #204 and #205; thanks @grrolland
  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1
- make call_userinfo_endpoint a public function; closes #207; thanks @thomasleplus

  redirect URI. The existing redirect_uri_path option has been
  deprecated in favor of the new option.

09/17/2018
- added an optional "request decorator" option that can be used to augment
  the HTTP requests when lua-resty-openidc talks to the discovery,

- release 1.6.1

06/26/2018
- signature verification failed for RSA keys of a length different
  from 2048 bit when the JWK used a specific format; see #170

06/19/2018
- added post_logout_redirect_uri parameter that can be used to set
  the target after logging out of the OpenID Connect Provider ; see #168; thanks @thomasleplus

06/07/2018
- refer to updated lua-resty-jwt that supports OpenSSL 1.1.x ; see: #162; thanks @cdbattags

  included inside the token response); see #158; thanks @grrolland

05/24/2018
- add Cache-Control no-cache header to authorization requests to avoid replays of state/nonce;
  see zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc#321

04/28/2018
- release 1.5.4

04/27/2018
- disabled support for "none" alg tokens introduced with 1.5.2 by default.
  If you want to enable it, you will now have to explicitly set the accept_none_alg
  option to true.
- id tokens using a signature algorithm not announced by the discovery
  endpoint are now rejected.
- you can now specify which signing algorithm you expect a bearer token to
  use in order to avoid being tricked into accepting a rogue token signed
  with a symmetric key when expecting an asymmetric cypher.
- added an option to reject tokens signed by an algorithm not supported by lua-resty-jwt

04/19/2018
- added support for passing bearer token as cookie
- added support introspection interval
- added support for passing request cookies on introspection call
- added passing introspection endpoint authorization method into openidc_call_token_endpoint call 

04/11/2018
- bugfix rare case where OP public key is starting with 0x80 byte, and thus resulting in
  systematic token signature verification error with message "too long"

02/08/2018
- added functions to manually request the invalidation of the caches; see #142

02/06/2018
- added more logging that may help debugging configuration; see #140; thanks @pamiel

01/30/2018
- add support for configuring an outgoing proxy; see #139
- release 1.5.3

01/28/2018
- correct iat checks: make sure it is not in the future rather than being too old; see #137

01/06/2018
- add support for Forwarded header; see #128
- add debug info about reasons for re-authentication; see #130

12/30/2017

12/14/2017
- release 1.5.2

12/13/2017

12/08/2017
- avoid putting a negative TTL into the cache; closes #127; thanks @ChristianCiach and @gwkunze

12/04/2017

- correct README.md around lua-resty-jwt requirement
- make handling of missing `jwks_uri` more robust

11/17/2017
- added support for verifying HMAC signatures on id tokens - it has
  already been supported for access tokens before
- fix handling of signatures using unsupported algorithms on id
  tokens. Such signatures will cause a warning to be logged but the id
  tokens are considered valid. access tokens signed with an
  unsupported algorithm are considered invalid. This is the same
  behavior as has been present in 1.4.1. See #122
- release 1.5.1

11/15/2017
- fix return of access_token when renew_access_token_on_expiry = false ; see #121

11/14/2017
- release 1.5.0

11/13/2017
- provided explicit control over whether the access token gets renewed
  on expiry. If refresh fails, the user is redirected to the OP's
  authorization endpoint.

- added support for configurable network timeouts

11/01/2017
- now uses cjson.safe when decoding JSON received from external sources for improved error handling

10/30/2017

10/28/2017
- add id_token_hint when calling end_session_endpoint

10/27/2017
- ensured id_token_hint uses the correct query string separator when
  opts.redirect_after_logout_uri is used together with redirect_after_logout_with_id_token_hint

10/24/2017
- verify RSA signatures on JWTs (id_token/access_token); thanks @venkatmarepalli
- rely on lua-resty-jwt validators for id_token and/or JWT access_token validation
- unify JWT access token and OIDC id_token validation
- added many more tests

10/11/2017

- check that sub returned from the userinfo endpoint matches sub in the id_token
- allow for id_tokens with alg set to "none" and no signature part
- add more logs

10/03/2017
- ignore any configured token_endpoint_auth_method that the library doesn't support (and log an error) and
  fall back to the first token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported the library can use; thanks @bodewig
