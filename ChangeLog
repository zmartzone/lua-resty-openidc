11/17/2017
- added support for verifying HMAC signatures on id tokens - it has
  already been supported for access tokens before
- fix handling of signatures using unsupported algorithms on id
  tokens. Such signatures will cause a warning to be logged but the id
  tokens are considered valid. access tokens signed with an
  unsupported algorithm are considered invalid. This is the same
  behavior as has been present in 1.4.1. See #122
- release 1.5.1

11/15/2017
- fix return of access_token when renew_access_token_on_expiry = false ; see #121

- add more logs

10/03/2017
